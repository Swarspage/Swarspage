# 👋 Hi, I’m Swar (Swar Sangram Shinde)

**Student · Aspiring AI Engineer · Frontend Developer**  
Welcome to my portfolio — a small collection of projects, experiments, and things I build while learning and having fun.

## ✨ About this portfolio
This repository contains my personal portfolio website — a living playground for UI experiments, small web apps, and hackathon builds. It’s built with modern frontend tools and is continuously evolving.  
Think of this as the index of my learning journey: neat UI components, real API integrations, and progressively better UX with every commit.
