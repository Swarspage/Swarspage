# Hi, I'm Swar (Swar Sangram Shinde)  👋

**Aspiring AI Engineer · Frontend Developer · Lifelong learner**

I build interactive, real-world web projects using React, Tailwind, and smart animations. My current portfolio showcases API integrations, sleek UI cards, and copy-to-clipboard tools—all built with the kind of polish I'm always improving.
